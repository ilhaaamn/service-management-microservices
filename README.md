# Personal Note

Here is a microservice that I have created related to Take Home Test which is sent via email.

In this microservice, there is still much that can be improved, starting from security, auditing, and in terms of ticket transactions, for example with Camunda Workflow so that every transition from each ticket can be clearer, configurable, and more structured.
